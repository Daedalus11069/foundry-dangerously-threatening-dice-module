Only use with the fork of dice-so-nice I created: https://github.com/Daedalus11069/dice-so-nice-fork

# Preamble

This is an experimental module because of the fact that I have not gotten it to consisitently not crash Dice So Nice when multiple dice are rolled at the same time.
Because of this fact, I have had to fork dice-so-nice.

# Installation

To install, follow these steps:

1.  Inside Foundry, select the Game Modules tab in the Configuration and Setup menu.
2.  Click the Install Module button and enter the following URL: https://github.com/Daedalus11069/foundry-dangerously-threatening-dice-module/releases/latest/download/module.json
3.  Click Install and wait for installation to complete.

# Usage

To use, rolls **must** use the format of: `/roll 1d20[optional reason error:number threat:number]`; examples:

- `/roll 1d20[some reason error:3 threat:18]`
- `/roll 4d20[some reason here threat:20 error:5]`
