DO NOT USE MULTIPLE ROLLS AT A TIME.

This is an experimental module because of the fact that I have not gotten it to consisitently not crash Dice So Nice when multiple dice are rolled at the same time.
Because of this fact, I have had to limit the dice type to d20 and only have it respond to the first roll in a group. Still, it is possible to spam rolls via chat messages or macros. Doing this has a high chance of crashing Dice So Nice, so don't do that.

To use, rolls **must** use the format of: `/roll 1d20[optional reason error:number threat:number]`; examples:

- `/roll 1d20[some reason error:3 threat:18]`
- `/roll 1d20[some reason here threat:20 error:5]`

If rolling multiple numbers, give each its own roll. The module does not currently support a `XdY` with an `X` higher than 1.
